## ***U.S-CANADA BORDER ***
---

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I analyzed a 390,000-record dataset related to the US and Canada border activity. The dataset spanned from 2019 to 2022 and included metrics such as border crossings, transportation methods, and trade volume. My analysis focused on identifying trends in cross-border movement, understanding economic impacts. SQL was used extensively to query, clean, and aggregate the data for further analysis.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

## ***Database Setup & Design***

Schema Structure
_ The Database contain 1 tables: 'U.S-CANADA BORDER'. 
_ These tables Design with primary key and proper indexing to maintain data integrity , optimize query performance

---

## ***Constraints***
_ Referential integrity is enforced using primary keys. 
_ Default values and data types are applied where necessary to maintain consistency. 
_ Uniqueness is guaranteed for fields like 'port_name'.

---

## *** Data Cleaning***
I cleaned the dataset by:

• Removing duplicates: Duplicates in the us_canda border table were identified and removed. 
• Handling missing values: Null values in critical fields (e.g.STATES,VALUE) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods

## ***Identifying Business Problems***
Key business problems identified:

1.Fluctuations in Cross-Border Traffic: Significant variations in border crossings may be affecting trade consistency and resource allocation for border management.
2.Discrepancies in Transportation Methods: Certain transportation methods show irregular usage patterns, leading to inefficiencies in handling and processing cross-border goods.
3.Delays in Trade Volume Processing: Delays and inconsistencies in processing trade volumes across the border are causing disruptions in supply chains and affecting timely deliveries.
4.Impact of External Factors on Border Activity: External factors like policy changes, pandemics, or geopolitical issues are influencing border activity, making forecasting and planning more challenging

## ***Objectives***
The primary objective of this project is to show the sql profficiency through queries but address real world bussiness challenges. This project covers various operations, 
including: 
_Measures
_transportation Management
_Values

## ***Learning Outcomes***
This project enabled me to: 
_ Design and implement a normalized database schema.
_ Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis. 
_ Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins. 
_ Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
_ Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

## ***Conclusion***
This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to uncovering operational challenges, this project provides valuable insights into business decision-making processes. 

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and drive business decision making
